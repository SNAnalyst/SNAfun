Determine the gof and plot the gof, using the btergm approach

\details{
For a fitted \code{ergm} or \code{btergm}, this function calculates 
the goodness of fit (\code{gof}) and plots it. 
This is done using the \code{btergm} engine, which also works for 
fitted \code{ergm} models.

For calculating the gof, btergm provides the option to check the fit of the 
model against a range of statistics. 
See \link[btergm]{gof-statistics} for an overview of the available statistics 
to check against. Note that these partly overlap with statistics available 
in the \code{ergm} package, but not exactly. 
If a statistic is required that is not inluded in the \code{btergm} package 
for use in the \code{gof} function (such as "nodecov"), you need to use the 
\code{ergm} package for this and can not use this function.

The \code{...} argument allows one to pass arguments to the 
\link[btergm]{gof} function, such as \code{target}, \code{formula}, 
\code{parallel}, \code{ncpus}. 
See the help of \link[btergm]{gof} for the options.

Many messages that are returned during the whole process can be suppressed 
by setting \code{silent = TRUE} and \code{verbose = FALSE}.

NOTE: the goodness of fit is silently returned. The plot is 
always plotted.

NOTE: \code{ergm} and \code{btergm} are packages made by separate research 
groups. As a result, the objects and functions are not 100 percent 
compatible. If applying this function to an \code{ergm}-model returns 
weird errors, it is better to calculate the gof using the 
\code{ergm} package and then plot that (using \link{GOF_plot} or 
using the \code{ergm} package functions).
