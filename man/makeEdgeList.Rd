\usage{
makeEdgeList(names = NULL, attribute = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{A data frame with N columns where the first one has the survey 
respondents (edge origin), and the other columns express the destination of 
the edge}

\item{attribute}{A data frame with the same dimensions as the data frame in 
names, where each column has the corresponding attribute for the structure 
in the names data frame.}
}
\value{
a data frame
}
\description{
Makes an edge list from row data.
}
\details{
This function processes row network data producing a list of edges. 
The function returns a data frame. 
If only the argument `names` is specified, the function returns a data frame
with two columns, indicating the node from which the link comes from in column 
one and the node to which the link is directed in column two. 

If the argument `attribute` is also specified, the function returns a data frame
with three columns. The first two columns are the same as above, the third 
column contain information about one node attribute

It is not possible to process more than one attribute at the time.

The function takes only data frames as input and the first column in the
input data frame needs to express the nodes originating the edges. 

The user should provide the values of 
names and attributes in the same order
