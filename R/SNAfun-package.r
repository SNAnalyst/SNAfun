#'
#' Package supporting the SNA4DS course
#'
#' Functions, useful for the SNA4DS course. A series of functions that provide 
#' a (fairly) consistent API to deal with \code{network} and \code{igraph} 
#' graph objects. It reduces the need (well, some of it) to constantly switch 
#' between the \code{network}, \code{sna}, and \code{igraph} packages, as is 
#' typical of most real life network analysis projects.
#' Where that switch is still needed, the \code{snafun} makes it much less 
#' painful and, yes, even fun.
#' In short: SNA FUN!
