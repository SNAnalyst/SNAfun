#' centralityChart
#'
#' Make a chart with centrality scores
#'
#' This function creates a facet path plot that displays the chosen centrality measures.
#' Currently, three centrality measures are implemented: "betweenness", "closeness"
#' , and degree". One or more of these can be chosen.
#'
#' The \code{mode} is any of "all", "out", "in", "total". Character string,
#' defines the types of the paths used for measuring the distance in directed
#' graphs. “in” measures the paths to a vertex, “out” measures paths from a
#' vertex, all uses undirected paths. This argument is ignored for undirected
#' graphs.
#'
#' The names of the vertices are plotted on the y-axis IF a \code{name} attribute
#' is present for the vertices. Otherwise, their IDs are used.
#'
#' The default is a point plot. Depending on the neatness of the network object,
#' it is possible to turn this into a nicer path plot. For this option, set
#' \code{path} to \code{TRUE}. Depending on the data, this can become a really nice
#' plot, or become really messy. This is why the default if \code{FALSE}. But feel
#' free to try it out on a dataset.
#'
#' The function takes an \code{igraph}-object as input.
#'
#' @param net a network of class \code{igraph}
#' @param measures one or more centrality measures
#' @param directed logical, should direction be taken into account? This argument
#' is optional, if it is not chosen the directionality of the network will be used.
#' @param mode Character, used for closeness and degree. The default is "all".
#' @param normalized Logical scalar, whether to normalize the centrality scores.
#' The default is \code{TRUE}, which makes the centralities more motually comparable.
#' @param ... other arguments passed to \code{\link{graphics}{dotchart}}.

#' @return a plot
