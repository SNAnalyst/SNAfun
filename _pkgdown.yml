  desc: |
    Indices at the level of the graph itself Functions starting with `count_*` provide a count of specific greaph-level attributes.  Functions starting with `g_*` calculate common graph-level indices, such as  mean distance, centralization, or reciprocity.

    A small set of datasets, mainly used in examples or testing. A more interesting set of data for the SNA4DS course can be found in the `SNA4DSData` package.
